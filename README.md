Outlier Detection - Credit Card Fraud Detection using Unsupervised ML

Outlier detection with machine learning algorithms is applicable in many fields. Automated transaction monitoring is an area where outlier detection is being used, especially in fighting financial crimes like credit card fraud and money laundering.
We will see the application of anomaly detection technique on credit card transactions through unsupervised machine learning methods.
